# DPPA

Matlab Code for analysing Diffraction Peak Profiles (DPPA). http://dmata.co.uk/dppa.html

Beta code will be available within July 2016, any help finding bugs would be greatly appreciated.
Future updates for van Berkums alternative method and the Variance method will be made available at a later time
